* use the debugger or print statements and do the following 
1. starting from the main function, check if all the parameters passed to constructors, functions, methods, etc. correctly.
2. in opengl applications it is crucial to check if all the opengl functions (Functions starting with gl) are used properly.
3. check if all the variables (int, char etc.) and struct variables are initiliased correctly.
4. check shader errors.
5. if the issue cannot be resolved by following the steps above, try implementing the simplest version of the application then build on top of it incrementaly.
